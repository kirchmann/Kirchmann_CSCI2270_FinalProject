# Kirchmann_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project	Summary
The program is made for analysing data and plotting the data. A class containing a vector will store the data.
If the user does not have data available it can be randomized. The library can find maximum value, minimum value,
variance, median, mean, standard deviation and sort the data using bubble or quicksort.


How to Run


This section	contains instructions,	
with	examples, of how to run your program. You	
should	also	include	a	link	here	
to the project documentation that you will provide in	
a	separate	file.

Dependencies

The code is using C++11 compiler. The libraries string, vector, iostream, in addition to these the mathgl library also has to be downloaded and included.
To install it use the following command in the terminal:
sudo apt-get install mathgl
 

This	section	contains	a	description	of	any	dependencies	that	your	program	requires.	
For	example,	if	your	program	relies	on	another	third-party	library	that	needs	to	be	
installed,	you	should	provide	a	description	of	where	to	find	that	library	and	
instructions	for	how	to	install	it.

System	Requirements
This program is for linux, UBUNTU 64 bit.

Open	issues/bugs

Would like to implement so that you can read a file instead of generating random numbers.
