# Kirchmann_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project	Summary:

The program is made for analysing data and plotting the data. A class containing a vector will store the data.
If the user does not have data available it can be randomized. The library can find maximum value, minimum value,
variance, median, mean, standard deviation and sort the data using bubble or quicksort.


How to Run:

Clone the project at:
https://github.com/kirchmann/Kirchmann_CSCI2270_FinalProject.git

This project contains the statisticsLibrary as well as example code, named "main-pfsalminen.cpp" (made by Paul Salminen). Make sure to download mathgl (see dependencies) 
before trying to run the code. In the folder sources use the file "main-pfsalminen.cpp" to see example code.



Dependencies:

The code is using C++11 compiler in codeblocks. The libraries string, vector, iostream, math, time are used. In addition to these the mathgl library 
also has to be downloaded and included.
To install the mathgl library use the following commands in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install mathgl
sudo apt-get install libmgl-dev

and then enter Y when asked if you want to download it.

If that does not work try going into the build options of your project and add libmgl to linker settings.


System	Requirements:

This program has only been run on linux, UBUNTU 64 bi in a virtual box.
