# Kirchmann_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project	Summary
The program is made for analysing data and plotting the data. A class containing a vector will store the data.
If the user does not have data available it can be randomized. The library can find maximum value, minimum value,
variance, median, mean, standard deviation and sort the data using bubble or quicksort.
