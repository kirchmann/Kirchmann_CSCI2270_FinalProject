# Kirchmann_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project	Summary
The program is made for analysing data and plotting the data. A class containing a vector will store the data.
If the user does not have data available it can be randomized. The library can find maximum value, minimum value,
variance, median, mean, standard deviation and sort the data using bubble or quicksort.


How to Run

Clone the project at:
https://github.com/kirchmann/Kirchmann_CSCI2270_FinalProject.git

This project contains the statisticsLibrary as well as example code, named "howToRun_examples.cpp". Make sure to download mathgl (see dependencies) 
before trying to run the code. In the folder sources use the file "howToRun_examples.cpp" to see example code.




Dependencies

The code is using C++11 compiler in codeblocks. The libraries string, vector, iostream, math, time are used. In addition to these the mathgl library 
also has to be downloaded and included.
To install the mathgl library use the following command in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install mathgl

and then enter Y when asked if you want to download it.


System	Requirements
This program has only been run on linux, UBUNTU 64 bi in a virtual box.

Open issues/bugs
No bugs ot issues have been found but further development when it comes to acquiring data is needed. Would like to implement so that you can read a file instead of
 generating random numbers but haven't figured out how to make it read any file. One way is to hardcode it for one type of datafile.
